# _SPECTRAL ANALYSIS_
## ATTENTION: in construction

### Notes to Josiah
- Anything you put in a folder called `data/` inside this repository will be ignored - I advise you put your data there.
- The `pickles/` folder is where all our compiled data should go. (This will not be hidden from github.)
- The `make_pickles.py` is the file where we munge and generate our pickles.
- The files `baseline_subtraction.py`, `find_peaks.py`, `allign_peaks.py`, `sum_spectra.py` all hold python classes with methods to be applied on our dataframes to apply respectively
- `Josiah.ipynb` is your analysis and workbench `.ipynb` - I won't touch it at all, I might look in it from time to time. (This is to avoid horrific merge conflicts). Same goes for `Isaac.ipynb`.
- `Final_codebook.ipynb` is where we will demo all our code that works
- `AI_use.md` - include all your ai use urls.
